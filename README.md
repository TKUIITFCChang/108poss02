## 108poss02: FlappyBird with Eyeblink detection

### Overview

This is a program that is a addon to [FlapPyBird](https://github.com/sourabhv/FlapPyBird) that adds eye blinking to play the game and control the bird.
We use the opencv and dlib to detect the eye blink and use it to present a jump in the game.
### Installation

```shell
$git clone https://github.com/TKUIITFCChang/108poss02.git
$cd 108poss02
